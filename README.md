A simple "Hello World" homebrew application for PlayStation 2 using PS2SDK and gsKit.

## üéÆ Features

- **Graphics Version**: 2D graphics with animated elements using gsKit
- **Console Version**: Text-based output for debugging
- **Cross-platform**: Works on real PS2 hardware and PCSX2 emulator
- **Well-documented**: Comprehensive build and usage instructions

## Prerequisites

- PS2SDK installed at `/usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk`
- gsKit installed at `/usr/local/ps2dev/gsKit`
- PlayStation 2 console or PCSX2 emulator
- Method to run homebrew on PS2 (FreeMCBoot, SwapMagic, etc.)

## Project Structure

- `main.c` - Graphics-based Hello World with colored rectangles and animations
- `simple_main.c` - Console-based Hello World with text output
- `Makefile` - Build configuration for graphics version
- `Makefile.simple` - Build configuration for console version
- `build.sh` - Automated build script for both versions

## Building

### Quick Build (Recommended)
```bash
./build.sh
```

### Manual Build

#### Console Version
```bash
make -f Makefile.simple
```

#### Graphics Version
```bash
make
```

#### Clean Build Files
```bash
make clean
# or for simple version
make -f Makefile.simple clean
```

## Output Files

- `hello_world_simple.elf` - Console version executable (~1.3MB)
- `hello_world.elf` - Graphics version executable (~1.4MB)

## Features

### Console Version (`hello_world_simple.elf`)
- Text-based "Hello World" message
- Heartbeat counter output
- Minimal resource usage
- Compatible with all PS2 systems

### Graphics Version (`hello_world.elf`)
- 2D graphics using gsKit
- Blue rectangle with white border
- Colored corner indicators (red and green squares)
- Animated white rectangle that moves across the screen
- Frame counter with console output

## Running on PS2

1. Copy the `.elf` file to a USB drive or memory card
2. Use a homebrew launcher (like uLaunchELF) to run the file
3. The console version will display text output in the system console
4. The graphics version will show animated graphics on screen

## Running on PCSX2

1. Load the `.elf` file directly in PCSX2
2. The console version output can be viewed in the PCSX2 console window
3. The graphics version will display full-screen graphics
4. Enable console output in PCSX2 to see debug messages

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure PS2SDK is properly installed at `/usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk`
- Ensure gsKit is properly installed at `/usr/local/ps2dev/gsKit`
- Check that all PS2SDK environment variables are set
- Verify your PS2 can run homebrew applications
- For graphics issues, try the console version first
- If build fails, run `./build.sh` for detailed error output

## Technical Details

- The console version uses `printf()` for debug output
- The graphics version uses gsKit and dmaKit for 2D graphics
- Both versions run in infinite loops (standard for PS2 homebrew)
- Graphics version renders at ~60fps with vsync
- Press Reset button on PS2 to exit applications

## Development Notes

- Built with PS2SDK's EE (Emotion Engine) toolchain
- Uses MIPS R5900 assembly optimizations
- Compatible with both fat PS2 and slim PS2 models
- Can be run from memory card, USB, or network
